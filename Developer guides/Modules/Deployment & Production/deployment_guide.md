# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

- Understand how to deploy the Remo AI Assistant backend and frontend to production
- Learn step-by-step deployment for backend (Render, Railway, Heroku, Docker) and frontend (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Configure environment variables, domains, and SSL
- Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize deployments
- Know where to find deeper technical details and related guides

---

## 1. Overview

This guide covers deploying the Remo AI Assistant backend and frontend to production environments, with recommended stacks and best practices for configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

For initial setup, see [Building from Scratch](./building_from_scratch.md).

---

## 2. Backend Deployment

### 2.1 Render (Recommended)

- Prepare your repository and connect to Render
- Configure build/start commands and environment variables
- Deploy and verify with `/health` and `/chat` endpoints

### 2.2 Railway

- Connect your repo, configure service, set environment variables, deploy

### 2.3 Heroku

- Install Heroku CLI, create app, set buildpacks and environment, deploy

### 2.4 Docker

- Use provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for custom deployments

---

## 3. Frontend Deployment

### 3.1 Vercel (Recommended)

- Update API URL in frontend config
- Import project, configure build settings, set environment variables, deploy

### 3.2 Netlify

- Connect repo, configure build/publish, set environment variables, deploy

### 3.3 GitHub Pages

- Configure build scripts, install `gh-pages`, deploy

---

## 4. Environment Configuration

- **Backend:** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, AWS credentials, etc. in `.env`
- **Frontend:** Set `VITE_API_URL` and other public variables
- See [User-Specific Implementation Summary](./user_specific_implementation_summary.md) for user data isolation

---

## 5. Domain and SSL Setup

- Add custom domains in Vercel/Render and configure DNS
- Automatic SSL certificates provided by both platforms

---

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Use `/health` endpoint for backend health checks
- Monitor logs in Render, Railway, Heroku, or Docker
- Use Vercel/Netlify analytics for frontend

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Build failures:** Check requirements, clear cache, verify Python/Node versions
- **Runtime errors:** Check logs, verify environment variables, test locally
- **API connection issues:** Test `/health`, check CORS, verify API URL
- **Frontend issues:** Check build output, environment variables, TypeScript errors
- **Debugging:** Use logs, API endpoint tests, and health checks

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use secure environment variable management
- Validate all input and sanitize user data
- Configure CORS for specific domains in production
- Monitor performance and error rates
- Use direct routing for deterministic operations (see [Orchestration & Routing Guide](./orchestration_and_routing.md))
