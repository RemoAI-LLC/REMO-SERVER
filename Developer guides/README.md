## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Read the [Architecture Overview](./architecture_overview.md)** to understand the big picture
2. **Follow [Building from Scratch](./building_from_scratch.md)** to set up your environment
3. **Learn about recent improvements in [Intent Detection & Routing Improvements](./intent_detection_and_routing_improvements.md)**
4. **Add or modify agents using [Creating New Agents](./creating_new_agents.md)**
5. **Learn about orchestration in [Agent Orchestration & Routing](./orchestration_and_routing.md)**
6. **Understand memory in [Conversation Memory System](./conversation_memory_guide.md)**
7. **Visualize and debug with [Visualization & Debugging](./visualization_and_debugging.md)**

## üöÄ Example Use Cases

- **Email Agent**: Send, read, and organize emails
- **Calendar Agent**: Schedule meetings and manage events
- **Research Agent**: Search and summarize information
- **Shopping Agent**: Create lists and find products
- **Health Agent**: Track fitness and wellness goals

## üß† Memory System Features

The conversation memory system provides:

- **Persistent Context**: Remembers conversation state across turns
- **Intelligent Routing**: Routes messages based on context, not just keywords
- **Multi-turn Support**: Handles incomplete requests and follow-up responses
- **Intent Detection**: Automatically detects reminder and todo intents
- **Time Recognition**: Recognizes time expressions like "6am", "2pm", "tomorrow"
- **Conversation Persistence**: Saves and loads conversation history
- **Memory Types**: Supports buffer (short-term) and summary (long-term) memory
- **Adaptive Memory**: Can switch between memory types based on conversation length

## üéØ Intent Detection & Routing Features

The enhanced intent detection and routing system provides:

- **Natural Language Support**: Handles variations like "to do's", "todos", "todo list"
- **Clarification Detection**: Recognizes when users are correcting routing mistakes
- **False Positive Prevention**: Prioritizes todo keywords over reminder keywords
- **Task Extraction**: Intelligently extracts tasks from natural language
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Maintains conversation context for continuity
- **Priority-Based Routing**: Intent Detection > Context Routing > General Response
- **Direct Agent Routing**: Faster response times by avoiding supervisor overhead

### Intent Detection Quick Reference

| Intent Type | Keywords | Patterns | Example |
|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Todo** | "todo", "task", "to do", "to do's" | `add.*to.*to do` | "add groceries to my to do's" |
| **Reminder** | "remind", "reminder", "alarm" | `remind me to.*at` | "remind me to call mom at 6pm" |
| **Clarification** | "i asked", "i want", "add to do" | `i asked.*to do` | "i asked you to add the to do" |

### Quick Intent Testing

```python
from src.memory.memory_utils import MemoryUtils

# Test intent detection
is_todo, todo_details = MemoryUtils.detect_todo_intent("add groceries to my to do's")
is_reminder, reminder_details = MemoryUtils.detect_reminder_intent("remind me to call mom")

# Extract tasks
task = MemoryUtils.extract_task_from_message("add going to groceries to my to do's")
# Returns: "going to groceries"
```

### Memory Type Quick Reference

| Memory Type          | Use Case                                  | Pros                                               | Cons                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Buffer** (Default) | Daily conversations, task completion      | Exact context, fast, perfect for multi-turn        | Memory grows with conversation    |
| **Summary**          | Extended conversations, long sessions     | Constant memory usage, handles long conversations  | May lose details, slower          |
| **Vector** (Future)  | User preference learning, semantic search | Semantic search, scales well                       | Complex setup, requires vector DB |
| **Entity** (Future)  | Person/entity tracking, business apps     | Tracks specific entities, good for personalization | Limited context, entity-only      |

### Quick Memory Configuration

```python
# Default - perfect for most use cases
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="buffer")

# For long conversations
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="summary", max_tokens=2000)

# Auto-switch for long conversations
if len(memory_manager.get_recent_messages()) > 50:
    memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="summary")
```
