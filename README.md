# Remo - Your Personal AI Assistant

"Remo: A personal AI Assistant that can be hired by every human on the planet. Personal assistants are not just for the rich anymore."

## Why Remo?

In today's fast-paced world, people are overwhelmed with various tasks requiring different skills and information overload. And that's where Personal assistants can make our work easy!

But traditionally, personal assistants have been a luxury available only to the wealthy or executives. The average person cannot afford a full-time human personal assistant because they are costly. And that is why we have introduced Remo.

## Project Overview

Remo is built using three main components:

- **LangChain**: Provides the core LLM integration and chat model functionality
- **LangGraph**: Enables building stateful, multi-agent applications with a graph-based architecture
- **LangSmith**: Offers tracing, monitoring, and debugging capabilities for the LLM application

Remo is a human-like personal assistant designed to be accessible to everyone. It combines the power of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith to create an intelligent, responsive, and capable AI assistant that can help with various tasks.

- Task and project organization
- Research and information gathering
- Job application assistance
- Food ordering and delivery coordination
- Workflow automation
- Personal and professional task management
- Reminder and follow-up management
- Basic decision support

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Access to an LLM that supports tool-calling features (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Required API keys for your chosen LLM provider

## Core Components Explained

### 1. LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. In Remo:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Initialize the chat model
llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4")

# Example of using the model
response = llm.invoke([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
```

Key features:

- Model abstraction and management
- Message formatting and handling
- Integration with various LLM providers

### 2. LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications. It uses a graph-based architecture where:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START

# Define the state structure
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

# Create the graph
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add a node (function that processes messages)
def remo(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# Add the node to the graph
graph_builder.add_node("remo", remo)

# Connect the entry point to the remo node
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "remo")
```

Key concepts:

- **StateGraph**: A state machine that manages the flow of data
- **Nodes**: Functions that process data and return updates to the state
- **Edges**: Define how data flows between nodes
- **State**: The current state of the conversation, including message history

### 3. LangSmith

LangSmith provides tracing and monitoring capabilities:

```python
import os
from langsmith import Client

# Set up LangSmith
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "your_project"

# Traces are automatically created when running the graph
graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]})
```

Features:

- Real-time tracing of LLM calls
- Performance monitoring
- Debugging tools
- Trace visualization

## Project Structure

```
.
├── .env                    # Environment variables
├── requirements.txt        # Project dependencies
├── remo.py                # Main Remo implementation
└── README.md              # This documentation
```

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done
deactivate
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key_here
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=your_project_name
```

## Running Remo

1. Start Remo:

```bash
python remo.py
```

2. Interact with Remo:

```python
# Example interaction
You: Hello!
Remo: Hi! I'm Remo, your advanced AI assistant. How can I help you today?

You: Can you help me organize my tasks?
Remo: I'd be happy to help you organize your tasks! I can assist with creating to-do lists, setting reminders, and managing your workflow. Would you like to start by listing your current tasks?
```

3. View traces in LangSmith:

- Visit [LangSmith Dashboard](https://smith.langchain.com)
- Navigate to your project
- View traces for each conversation

## Key Features

### 1. Stateful Conversations

```python
# Messages are automatically appended to the state
state = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi! How can I help you today?"}
    ]
}
```

### 2. Streaming Responses

```python
# Real-time response streaming
for event in graph.stream(state):
    print("Remo:", event["messages"][-1].content)
```

### 3. Tracing and Monitoring

```python
# Each interaction is traced
with Client() as client:
    run = client.create_run(
        name="remo_interaction",
        inputs={"messages": state["messages"]}
    )
```

### 4. Error Handling

```python
try:
    response = graph.invoke(state)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Remo: I encountered an error: {e}")
    print("Please try again or let me know if you need help with something else.")
```

## Dependencies
