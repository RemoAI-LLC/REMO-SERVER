# Remo - Your Personal AI Assistant

"Remo: A personal AI Assistant that can be hired by every human on the planet. Personal assistants are not just for the rich anymore."

**Now powered by multi-agent orchestration with specialized agents for enhanced capabilities!**

## Why Remo?

In today's fast-paced world, people are overwhelmed with various tasks requiring different skills and information overload. And that's where Personal assistants can make our work easy!

But traditionally, personal assistants have been a luxury available only to the wealthy or executives. The average person cannot afford a full-time human personal assistant because they are costly. And that is why we have introduced Remo.

## Project Overview

Remo is built using advanced AI orchestration technologies:

- **LangChain**: Provides the core LLM integration and chat model functionality
- **LangGraph**: Enables building stateful, multi-agent applications with a graph-based architecture
- **LangSmith**: Offers tracing, monitoring, and debugging capabilities for the LLM application
- **LangGraph Supervisor**: Powers multi-agent orchestration and coordination

Remo is a human-like personal assistant designed to be accessible to everyone. It combines the power of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith with specialized AI agents to create an intelligent, responsive, and capable AI assistant that can help with various tasks.

## ðŸš€ New: Multi-Agent Orchestration

Remo now features a sophisticated multi-agent system that coordinates specialized AI agents for different tasks:

### **Available Specialists:**

1. **Reminder Agent** ðŸ“…

   - Manages reminders, alerts, and scheduled tasks

2. **Todo Agent** âœ…
   - Handles todo lists and task organization
   - Manages project priorities and categories
   - Tracks task completion and progress

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Access to an LLM that supports tool-calling features (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Required API keys for your chosen LLM provider

## Core Components Explained

### 1. LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. In Remo:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Initialize the chat model
llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4")

# Example of using the model
response = llm.invoke([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
```

Key features:

- Model abstraction and management
- Message formatting and handling
- Integration with various LLM providers

### 2. LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications. It uses a graph-based architecture where:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START

# Define the state structure
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

# Create the graph
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add a node (function that processes messages)
def remo(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# Add the node to the graph
graph_builder.add_node("remo", remo)

# Connect the entry point to the remo node
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "remo")
```

Key concepts:

- **StateGraph**: A state machine that manages the flow of data
- **Nodes**: Functions that process data and return updates to the state
- **Edges**: Define how data flows between nodes
- **State**: The current state of the conversation, including message history

### 3. LangSmith

LangSmith provides tracing and monitoring capabilities:

```python
import os
from langsmith import Client

# Set up LangSmith
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "your_project"

# Traces are automatically created when running the graph
graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]})
```

Features:

- Real-time tracing of LLM calls
- Performance monitoring
- Debugging tools
- Trace visualization

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration

The new multi-agent system uses LangGraph Supervisor for coordination:

```python
from src.orchestration import SupervisorOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = SupervisorOrchestrator(model_name="gpt-4")

# Process requests through specialized agents
response = orchestrator.process_request("Set a reminder for tomorrow's meeting")
```

Key features:

- **Supervisor Pattern**: Centralized coordination of specialized agents
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic detection and routing of task types
- **Seamless Integration**: Maintains conversation flow across agents
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent has focused capabilities

Initializing Remo with multi-agent orchestration...

ðŸ¤– Remo is ready to assist you!
ðŸ”„ Now powered by specialized agents for reminders and todo management

ðŸ“‹ Available Specialists:
   â€¢ Reminder Agent: Manages reminders, alerts, and scheduled tasks
   â€¢ Todo Agent: Manages todo lists, tasks, and project organization

How can I help you today?

You: Set a reminder for my dentist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM
Remo: I'll help you set that reminder through our specialized reminder system.

âœ… Reminder set: 'Dentist appointment' for 2024-01-16 14:00

## Architecture Details

### Multi-Agent Flow

1. **User Input** â†’ `remo.py`
2. **Request Analysis** â†’ Detects specialized keywords (reminder, todo, etc.)
3. **Agent Routing** â†’ Routes to appropriate specialized agent(s)
4. **Specialized Processing** â†’ Agent handles the request with focused expertise
5. **Response Aggregation** â†’ Supervisor combines responses if multiple agents involved
6. **User Output** â†’ Returns coordinated response maintaining Remo's personality

### State Management

- **Persistent Storage**: Reminders and todos are stored in JSON files
- **Conversation History**: Maintained across agent interactions
- **Context Preservation**: User preferences and patterns are remembered

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Fallbacks**: If specialized agents fail, falls back to basic Remo
- **Error Recovery**: Continues operation even if individual components fail
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Development

### Adding New Agents

To add a new specialized agent:

1. Create a new agent directory in `src/agents/`
2. Implement agent class with `get_agent()`, `get_name()`, and `get_description()` methods
3. Add agent tools in a separate `*_tools.py` file
4. Update `SupervisorOrchestrator` to include the new agent
5. Update routing logic in `remo.py`

### Customizing Agent Behavior

Each agent can be customized by:

- Modifying the persona in the agent class
- Adding new tools to the agent's toolset
- Adjusting temperature and other LLM parameters
- Customizing the supervisor's routing logic
