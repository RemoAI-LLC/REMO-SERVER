# Remo - Your Personal AI Assistant

"Remo: A personal AI Assistant that can be hired by every human on the planet. Personal assistants are not just for the rich anymore."

**Now powered by multi-agent orchestration with specialized agents for enhanced capabilities and conversation memory for seamless multi-turn interactions!**

## Why Remo?

In today's fast-paced world, people are overwhelmed with various tasks requiring different skills and information overload. And that's where Personal assistants can make our work easy!

But traditionally, personal assistants have been a luxury available only to the wealthy or executives. The average person cannot afford a full-time human personal assistant because they are costly. And that is why we have introduced Remo.

## Project Overview

Remo is built using advanced AI orchestration technologies:

- **LangChain**: Provides the core LLM integration and chat model functionality
- **LangGraph**: Enables building stateful, multi-agent applications with a graph-based architecture
- **LangSmith**: Offers tracing, monitoring, and debugging capabilities for the LLM application
- **LangGraph Supervisor**: Powers multi-agent orchestration and coordination
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multi-turn conversations

Remo is a human-like personal assistant designed to be accessible to everyone. It combines the power of LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith with specialized AI agents and conversation memory to create an intelligent, responsive, and capable AI assistant that can help with various tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Access to an LLM that supports tool-calling features (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google Gemini)
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Required API keys for your chosen LLM provider

## Core Components Explained

### 1. LangChain

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. In Remo:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

# Initialize the chat model
llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4")

# Example of using the model
response = llm.invoke([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
```

Key features:

- Model abstraction and management
- Message formatting and handling
- Integration with various LLM providers

### 2. LangGraph

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-agent applications. It uses a graph-based architecture where:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START

# Define the state structure
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

# Create the graph
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add a node (function that processes messages)
def remo(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# Add the node to the graph
graph_builder.add_node("remo", remo)

# Connect the entry point to the remo node
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "remo")
```

Key concepts:

- **StateGraph**: A state machine that manages the flow of data
- **Nodes**: Functions that process data and return updates to the state
- **Edges**: Define how data flows between nodes
- **State**: The current state of the conversation, including message history

### 3. LangSmith

LangSmith provides tracing and monitoring capabilities:

```python
import os
from langsmith import Client

# Set up LangSmith
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "your_project"

# Traces are automatically created when running the graph
graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]})
```

Features:

- Real-time tracing of LLM calls
- Performance monitoring
- Debugging tools
- Trace visualization

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration

The new multi-agent system uses LangGraph Supervisor for coordination:

```python
from src.orchestration import SupervisorOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = SupervisorOrchestrator(model_name="gpt-4")

# Process requests through specialized agents
response = orchestrator.process_request("Set a reminder for tomorrow's meeting")
```

Key features:

- **Supervisor Pattern**: Centralized coordination of specialized agents
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic detection and routing of task types
- **Seamless Integration**: Maintains conversation flow across agents
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent has focused capabilities

### 5. Conversation Memory System

The conversation memory system maintains context across multi-turn conversations:

```python
from src.memory import ConversationMemoryManager, ConversationContextManager

# Initialize memory system
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="buffer")
context_manager = ConversationContextManager()

# Start conversation
memory_manager.start_conversation()
context_manager.start_conversation()

# Add messages to memory
memory_manager.add_message("user", "Set a reminder for tomorrow")
memory_manager.add_message("assistant", "What time would you like the reminder?")

# Check context for routing
target_agent = context_manager.should_route_to_agent("6am", ["reminder_agent"])
```

Key features:

- **Persistent Context**: Remembers conversation state across turns
- **Intent Detection**: Automatically detects reminder and todo intents
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Routes messages based on conversation context
- **Pending Request Management**: Tracks incomplete requests
- **Conversation Persistence**: Saves and loads conversation history

#### Memory Types

Remo supports different memory types for different use cases:

**Buffer Memory (Default - Short-term)**:

```python
# Perfect for multi-turn task completion
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="buffer")
```

- ‚úÖ Preserves exact conversation history
- ‚úÖ Fast access to recent messages
- ‚úÖ Perfect for "set alarm" ‚Üí "6am" scenarios
- ‚ùå Memory usage grows with conversation length

**Summary Memory (Long-term)**:

```python
# For extended conversations
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="summary", max_tokens=2000)
```

- ‚úÖ Constant memory usage
- ‚úÖ Handles very long conversations
- ‚úÖ Good for persistent user sessions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May lose specific details in summarization

**Auto-switching Memory**:

```python
# Automatically switch to summary memory for long conversations
if len(memory_manager.get_recent_messages()) > 50:
    memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="summary")
```

#### Memory Configuration

Configure memory based on your needs:

```python
# For daily personal assistant use (recommended)
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(memory_type="buffer")

# For extended conversations
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager(
    memory_type="summary",
    max_tokens=2000
)

# Monitor memory usage
message_count = len(memory_manager.get_recent_messages())
if message_count > 50:
    print("Consider switching to summary memory")
```
